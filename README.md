# MixedRealityRemoteMaintenanceProject
 My Graduation Project with HoloLens 2.
In my project, I  created a multi-user virtual environment and enabled users to do activities such as learning, remote  maintenance-repair with each other and interact with the holograms in the application in this virtual  environment. I was able to present this project to the user experience by integrating it with HoloLens 2 devices.  While I was involved in the development phase of this project, I provided communication between users  using WebRTC for real-time audio/video communication.
